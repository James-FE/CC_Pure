 * Unified gate for the cron scheduling system. Combines the build-time

 * `tengu_kairos_cron` GrowthBook gate on a 5-minute refresh window.
 *
 * AGENT_TRIGGERS is independently shippable from KAIROS — the cron module
 * graph (cronScheduler/cronTasks/cronTasksLock/cron.ts + the three tools +
 * /loop skill) has zero imports into src/assistant/ and no feature('KAIROS')
 * calls. The REPL.tsx kairosEnabled read is safe:
 * kairosEnabled is unconditionally in AppStateStore with default false, so
 * when KAIROS is off the scheduler just gets assistantMode: false.
 *
 * Called from Tool.isEnabled() (lazy, post-init) and inside useEffect /
 * imperative setup, never at module scope — so the disk cache has had a
 * chance to populate.
 *
 * The default is `true` — /loop is GA (announced in changelog). GrowthBook
 * is disabled for Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry and when DISABLE_TELEMETRY /
 * CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC are set; a `false` default would
 * break /loop for those users (GH #31759). The GB gate now serves purely as
 * a fleet-wide kill switch — flipping it to `false` stops already-running
 * schedulers on their next isKilled poll tick, not just new ones.
 *
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON` is a local override that wins over GB.

  return `Schedule a natural-language prompt for Claude to act on at a future time. Use for both recurring schedules and one-shot reminders. The prompt you pass is an instruction Claude will reason about when it fires (e.g. "check the deploy and report status", "summarize today's PRs") — it is fed to the model as a message, not executed by a shell.

## Resolve unknowns from the workspace first

If the user's task mentions something you don't recognize (a project name, a file path, a service, a "production line"), do NOT halt to ask the user. First, search the workspace: read relevant files, grep the codebase, list directories. You will almost always find the answer there. Only ask the user for clarification after you have searched and still cannot determine what they mean.

## When NOT to use this tool

If the user wants to schedule a shell script or shell command at the OS level — anything you would run with Bash, like "./backup.sh", "pg_dump ...", or a binary — do NOT use this tool. Use the Bash tool to install a real OS crontab entry instead (e.g. \`(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 3 * * * /abs/path/backup.sh") | crontab -\`). This tool only fires while this Claude session's REPL is open and idle, so it cannot reliably run unattended scripts. CronCreate is for tasks that need Claude's reasoning at fire time; crontab is for executing commands.

Uses standard 5-field cron in the user's local timezone: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week. "0 9 * * *" means 9am local — no timezone conversion needed.

## One-shot tasks (recurring: false)

For "remind me at X" or "at <time>, do Y" requests — fire once then auto-delete.
Pin minute/hour/day-of-month/month to specific values:
  "remind me at 2:30pm today to check the deploy" → cron: "30 14 <today_dom> <today_month> *", recurring: false
  "tomorrow morning, run the smoke test" → cron: "57 8 <tomorrow_dom> <tomorrow_month> *", recurring: false

## Recurring jobs (recurring: true, the default)

For "every N minutes" / "every hour" / "weekdays at 9am" requests:
  "*/5 * * * *" (every 5 min), "0 * * * *" (hourly), "0 9 * * 1-5" (weekdays at 9am local)

## Avoid the :00 and :30 minute marks when the task allows it

Every user who asks for "9am" gets \`0 9\`, and every user who asks for "hourly" gets \`0 *\` — which means requests from across the planet land on the API at the same instant. When the user's request is approximate, pick a minute that is NOT 0 or 30:
  "every morning around 9" → "57 8 * * *" or "3 9 * * *" (not "0 9 * * *")
  "hourly" → "7 * * * *" (not "0 * * * *")
  "in an hour or so, remind me to..." → pick whatever minute you land on, don't round

Only use minute 0 or 30 when the user names that exact time and clearly means it ("at 9:00 sharp", "at half past", coordinating with a meeting). When in doubt, nudge a few minutes early or late — the user will not notice, and the fleet will.

## Runtime behavior

Jobs only fire while the REPL is idle (not mid-query). ${durableRuntimeNote}The scheduler adds a small deterministic jitter on top of whatever you pick: recurring tasks fire up to 10% of their period late (max 15 min); one-shot tasks landing on :00 or :30 fire up to 90 s early. Picking an off-minute is still the bigger lever.

Recurring tasks auto-expire after ${DEFAULT_MAX_AGE_DAYS} days — they fire one final time, then are deleted. This bounds session lifetime. Tell the user about the ${DEFAULT_MAX_AGE_DAYS}-day limit when scheduling recurring jobs.
